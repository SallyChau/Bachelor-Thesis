A thesis written by Sally Chau

For the completion of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Bonn, I composed a thesis in algorithmic game theory. I concentrated on the complexity of Congestion Games reaching a Nash-Equilibrium. Therefore, I analyzed the complexity of minimising the Rosenthal Potential. 

The result of thesis can be found in the document "BA.pdf".
