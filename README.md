# Bachelor Thesis: Complexity in Congestion Games and the Nash-Equilibrium

_University of Bonn, 2nd term 2015_

_Supervisor: Prof. Dr. Heiko RÃ¶glin (http://roeglin.org/)_

A thesis written by Sally Chau

For the completion of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Bonn, I composed a thesis in algorithmic game theory. I concentrated on the complexity of Congestion Games reaching a Nash-Equilibrium. Therefore, I analyzed the complexity of minimizing the Rosenthal Potential.
